**-----------------Hello there!---------------------**

During the development of this project we have problems to code it. So you can find our project that converts a decimal number to binary system reflecting in our
circuit that we do in our protoboard using Arduino. These are the material that we used.

            Materials:
            - 4 Leds (It doesn't matter the colour)
            - 1 Arduino
            - 1 Protoboard
            - Jumpers or tinned wire
            - 4 Resistors of 330 ohms
           
This is the way that we do the circuit:
